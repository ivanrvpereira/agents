# Agent Instructions

Shared instructions for all AI coding agents.

## Code Quality

- Write idiomatic, simple, maintainable code
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Clean up dead code ruthlessly
- DRY, YAGNI — only build what's needed
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- No over-engineering: don't add features, abstractions, or error handling beyond what's asked

## Workflow

- Read existing code before modifying
- Plan before coding on non-trivial tasks
- Research before adding dependencies
- Verify changes work before claiming completion

## Collaboration

- Ask about trade-offs when multiple approaches exist
- Respond point-by-point to review feedback
- Use `gh` for GitHub operations
- Don't push, open PRs, or merge without explicit approval

## Git

- Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`, imperative mood, under 72 chars
- Never add AI attribution to commits — no co-author lines, no "Generated by" footers
- One logical change per commit
- Never force push to main

## Tools

Prefer modern CLI tools over traditional Unix commands:
- `jq` for JSON processing
- `sd 'pattern' 'replacement'` instead of `sed`
- `gh` for all GitHub operations
- `procs` for process inspection instead of `ps aux | grep`

## Fetch gihub.com content

Use gh to fetch content from github instead of other crawlers

## Safety

- Use `trash` over `rm` — recoverable deletion
- Ask before destructive or hard-to-reverse actions (force push, reset --hard, drop tables, delete branches)
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- Investigate unexpected state before overwriting — it may be in-progress work
